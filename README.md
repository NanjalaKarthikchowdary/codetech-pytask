1. Module Overview:
   - The module contains functions for performing arithmetic operations and a main function to execute the calculator program.

2. Functions:

    2.1. add(x, y):
        - Description: This function adds two numbers.
        - Parameters:
            - x: The first operand (number).
            - y: The second operand (number).
        - Returns: The sum of x and y.

    2.2. subtract(x, y):
        - Description: This function subtracts one number from another.
        - Parameters:
            - x: The minuend (number to be subtracted from).
            - y: The subtrahend (number to subtract).
        - Returns: The difference between x and y.

    2.3. multiply(x, y):
        - Description: This function multiplies two numbers.
        - Parameters:
            - x: The first factor (number).
            - y: The second factor (number).
        - Returns: The product of x and y.

    2.4. divide(x, y):
        - Description: This function divides one number by another.
        - Parameters:
            - x: The dividend (number to be divided).
            - y: The divisor (number to divide by).
        - Returns: The quotient of x divided by y. If y is zero, it returns an error message.

    2.5. exponentiate(x, y):
        - Description: This function raises a number to the power of another number.
        - Parameters:
            - x: The base (number to be raised to a power).
            - y: The exponent (power to raise the base to).
        - Returns: The result of x raised to the power of y.

    2.6. calculator():
        - Description: This is the main calculator function that provides a menu-driven interface for performing arithmetic operations.
        - Behavior:
            - Displays a welcome message and a menu of available operations.
            - Prompts the user for their choice of operation.
            - Reads user input and performs the selected operation.
            - Continues looping until the user chooses to quit.
        - Input: User's choice of operation and input numbers.
        - Output: Result of the operation or an error message (if applicable).

3. Main Execution:
    - The calculator function is called to start the program execution.

4. Usage Instructions:
    - Run the script in a Python environment.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to select the desired arithmetic operation and input numbers.
    - Choose the '6' option to quit the calculator.

5. Error Handling:
    - The program handles division by zero error by checking if the divisor is zero before performing division.

6. Additional Considerations:
    - Input validation can be added to ensure that the user enters valid numeric inputs.
    - Error handling for invalid input choices can be improved to provide clearer error messages.
    - Additional advanced features such as square root, modulus operation, etc., can be implemented for enhanced functionality.

Simple Calculator with Advanced Features Documentation
Introduction
This Python program is a simple calculator with advanced features. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Additionally, it provides the option to quit the calculator.

Features
Addition: Add two numbers together.
Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
Division: Divide one number by another.
Exponentiation: Raise one number to the power of another.
Quit: Exit the calculator.
Usage
To use the calculator, run the Python script. Upon execution, the user is presented with a menu displaying available operations. The user can then input their choice of operation along with the numbers they want to perform the operation on.

Functions
add(x, y): Adds two numbers x and y and returns the result.
subtract(x, y): Subtracts y from x and returns the result.
multiply(x, y): Multiplies x by y and returns the result.
divide(x, y): Divides x by y and returns the result. Handles division by zero error.
exponentiate(x, y): Raises x to the power of y and returns the result.
calculator(): Implements the main calculator functionality. It displays a menu of available operations, prompts the user for input, performs the selected operation, and handles errors.
Execution Flow
The program starts by welcoming the user and displaying the available operations.
It prompts the user to select an operation or to quit.
If the user chooses an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponentiation), they are prompted to enter two numbers.
The program performs the chosen operation and displays the result.
If the user chooses to quit, the program ends with a farewell message.
Error Handling
Division by zero is handled by checking if the denominator is zero before performing division.
Invalid input is handled by prompting the user to try again.
Conclusion
This Python program provides a simple yet functional calculator with advanced features. It allows users to perform various arithmetic operations conveniently through a user-friendly interface.
